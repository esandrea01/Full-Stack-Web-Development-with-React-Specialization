# Full-Stack-Web-Development-with-Angular-Specialization

<p>This repository is created to keep track of the Full Stack Web Development with Angular Specialization by Coursera. This program is developed by The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.
  The first two courses in this Specialization cover front-end frameworks: Bootstrap 4 and Angular. On the server side, weâ€™ll learn to implement NoSQL databases using MongoDB, work within a Node.js environment and Express framework, and communicate to the client side through a RESTful API. Learners enrolling in this Specialization are expected to have prior working knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
