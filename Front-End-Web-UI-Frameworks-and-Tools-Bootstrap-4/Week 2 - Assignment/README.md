<h1 style="text-align:center;"><b>Assignment Requirements</b></h1>

This assignment requires you to complete the following three tasks. Detailed instructions for each task are given below. The picture of the completed web page included below indicates the location within the web page that will be updated by the three tasks.

<b>Task 1</b>

In this task you will be adding another content row to the page. The content row should contain the following:

1. You should create a reservation form for the user to reserve a table. The reservation form should contain a field using radio that enables the users to specify the number of guests (1-6).
2. The form should contain fields to specify the date and time of the reservation. The fields should contain appropriate placeholder information to identify the purpose of the fields.
3. The form should contain a button named Reserve to initiate reservation of the table.
4. The form should be enclosed inside a card with the heading "Reserve a Table". The card should occupy 8 columns and centred in the row for small to extra-large screens. For extra-small screens, the card should span the entire row.

<b>Task 2</b>

In this task you will be formatting the content in the second row of the page. The formatting should result in the following:

1. Format the content of the second column with the media class together with the media object class. Use the buffet.png image file provided for you in the img folder. The image should displayed to the right of the content description. See figure below.
2. Add a badge with the word “NEW” to the content as shown in the figure below.
 
<b>Task 3</b>

In this task you will be adding a block-sized button to the Jumbotron to the right of the restaurant logo:

1. The block-level button and the restaurant logo should share the right six columns of the row. The restaurant name and description can now be reduced to occupy the left six columns. Use the small button (btn-sm).
2. Clicking on the button should take you down to the form for reserving a table.
